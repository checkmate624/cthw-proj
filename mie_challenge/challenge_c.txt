Goal
----
 
Develop a program written in C that will handle decoding of a CGI query string.

Requirements
------------

1. Do the necessary research to determine which characters need to be decoded,
   and how that decoding is to be done.  Web based CGI data is encoded and
   stored as an ASCII string in the form:  var=something&var2=something
   You can see an example of this by visiting http://stackoverflow.com, entering
   a search, and seeing how the URL changes after you submit the page.

2. Your program should run from a command line interface in Linux (preferably)
   or DOS.  It should accept as a command line argument a string to decode.

3. Decode the query string, and for every key/value pair found, display the
   decoded key and value.

4. Do not link in or use any code except what can be found in the standard
   libraries.

5. Divide your code into a driver and a reusable CGI API.  The CGI API should
   do the parsing and decoding, provide functionality for retrieving specific
   values by their keys, and make it possible to retrieve all keys found.

6. The decoding process should have no hard-coded assumptions about the number
   or maximum sizes of keys and values.

7. Make detailed comments for every single function you write. Be prepared to
   defend and explain your design and how the different parts of your program
   work together.


Test Query Strings
------------------

You can test your program using these sample query strings:

q=c+programming
x=100&y=200
r=Avoid%20%3Cb%3E%22bold%22%3C%2Fb%3E%20tags.&v=A%2BB%3DB%2BA&z=A%26B
greeting=vavlI'%20quv%20Say'moHmeH%20nuj%20bIQ%20vIlo'chugh%2C%20nuj%20bIQ%20makevIlammoH.
Keys%2CShifted=!%40%23%24%25%5E%26*()_%2B
