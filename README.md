## Course Grading Scale
You should do all of the exercises in the book, but you can organize them in any way you like, and they will not be graded.  The projects described in this repository **will** be graded.  The points for all of the projects will be averaged together to determine your grade for the course.

* A: 90+
* B: 80-89
* C: 70-79
* D: 60-69
* F: < 60

## Project Grading Scale
* 40 pts - Provide a makefile, and source code compiles
* 20 pts - Attempt to solve the problem
* 20 pts - Solve the problem perfectly
* 10 pts - Elegant, unusual, or creative solution
* 10 pts - Compile without warnings
* 10 pts - Appropriate use of comments

The points above are cumulative, so for example, a well commented project that has a makefile and compiles without warnings, but makes no attempt to solve the problem is worth 60 points.  Note that it is possible to get over 100 points on a project.  There are no projects for the first few chapters of the book, but you still need to read those chapters and work through the exercises independently.
