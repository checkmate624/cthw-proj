# Chapter 7 - Variables and Types

Display various numeric types.

## Guidelines

* As always, create a Makefile that builds the main program, and call it "main"
* Create three variables, an 8-bit unsigned integer (uint8_t), a float, and a double.
* Initialize all variables to zero.
* Increment the float and double variables 10 times, and printf their values for each step.
* Set the integer to the highest numeric value it can hold without overflowing and printf it.
* Increment the integer value so that overflow happens and printf it.
