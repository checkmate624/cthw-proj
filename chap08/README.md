# Chapter 8 - If, Else-If, Else

Print out a random number between 0-9, spelled out in English.

## Guidelines

* Create a Makefile that builds the main program, and call it "main".  Future chapters will omit this direction, but continue to do this.
* See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rand-and-srand-in-ccpp/ for information about random number generation.
* Make sure that your program does **NOT** display the same number every time it runs.
* If the last digit of your random number is 3, your program should display "three", for example.
